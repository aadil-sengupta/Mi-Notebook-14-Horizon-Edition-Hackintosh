# Installation

### Note:-
This EFI is meant for the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition and while it can work on the non-Horizon edition, things such as sleep, Wifi, Dgpu disable, etc. might not work. Those trying to hackintosh the Non-Horizon version can Try using this one or tweak this EFI to suit you needs.<br>
<br>First We need to download macOS, to do so, we have a few options. I reccomend that you download a offline installer as installing macOS via the online installer has caused issues due to our wifi card. Another thing to note here. If you want to use apple services such as Imessaegs & Facetime. You will need to install Catalina first and then upgrade to Monterey or Big sur. Also, if you want to make things a bit easy, Please directly install Monterey. though Imessages wont work, its a much simpler process as i encountered several issues while upgrading from catalina to big sur & from big sur to Monterey.

<summary>Using a real Mac</summary>
  
  On a real Mac (a functional hackintosh will do as well) Download the installer for the desired version of macOS from the app store using the following links:-<br>
<br>[BigSur](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-big-sur/id1526878132?mt=12) <br>
[Monterey](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-monterey/id1576738294?mt=12)<br>
[Catalina](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/macos-catalina/id1466841314?mt=12)<br>
  <br>
Now, Insert your flash drive(14gb or more) open a terminal window and type the following depending on the macOS version you downloaded:-

  
      BigSur
      sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume

      Catalina
      sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Catalina.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume

      Monterey
      sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Monterey.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume

  Using a image from olarila.com

Olarila is a website that provides easy to use altered versions of macOS, These versions are the same at the core but are easy for hackintoshers like us to use, These can be direcrtly flashed to a pendrive using a program such as etcher. 
<br>Download the desired macOS version from [here](https://www.olarila.com/topic/6278-hackintosh-and-macintosh-olarila-vanilla-images-macos/)

  gibMacOS is a python script that can download macOS components directly from apple
From my experience, gibMacOS is great for online installation of macOS, but i do not recommend using the online installer due to our wifi card. gibMacOS can also download the offline installer of macOS but this method is much more difficult and i wouldnt reccomend it.

Now that we have out Pendrive with the MacOS bootable install, We are almost done.
First of download the EFI from the releases page of this repo. For those who are using the online installer of macOS, please switch to AirportITLWM or use the offline installer. another method is to edit the .pilist file present inside the itlwm kext & enter your wifi details there.

After altering the EFI, Paste it in a new partition of approximetly 200-500 mb in size. This partition can either me on the pendrive or in your system itself.

## Booting to the macOS Installer.

Boot using your EFI, Here you should automatically see the Apple logo, if this isnt the case. change the value of ShowPicker in the config.pilist file to True & select "Install MacOS [YOUR MACOS INSTALLER VERSION]".

It might take a few mins, but eventually you should see the MacOS Recovery screen.
